# RMS

Description
This project is about creating and building a software, specifically a web-based application, that manages the activity within a restaurant. The software is called RMS (Restaurant Management System). RMS can be used both by the clients and staff. It covers almost every procedure going on in the restaurant, from ordering meals to human resources management.
One of the main tasks of this web-app is ordering directly from a tablet, located in every table. The client can make the order and send it directly to the chefs in the kitchen. This is a very efficient way of ordering, as it saves time (waiting for a waiter, talking to the waiter etc) and might also avoid frustration and misunderstanding. Basically, the app has a designed GUI for the dishes; after ordering, one of the chefs claims the order and a notification is sent to the client, saying that his order has been taken + the estimated time of cooking + an option to print the bill. 
Another task being managed by the app is food products management. The list of products are updated everytime a new dish is cooked. This list is accessible to the accountant, who decides to make orders whenever the restaurant is running out of some specific product.
Human Resources - We've given the admin the options to add/delete/modify the staff and the accountant the ability to manage their salaries. Some members have a fixed salary, others are paid according to the numbers of the hours worked. 
Distributors - The accountant has a list of distributors and makes the ordering of the products. There is a part of the app taking care about this.
The web application is built using PHP, mySQL, and jQuery Mobile.
